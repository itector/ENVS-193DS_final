# Effects of Kangaroo Rat Mounds on Seed Banks of Grass and Shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (2001)

This README.txt file provides information about the data package "Effects of Kangaroo Rat Mounds on Seed Banks of Grass and Shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (2001)." It contains data related to the study conducted in 2001 on the effects of kangaroo rat mounds on seed banks in grass and shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico.

## General Information

-   Data Package: knb-lter-sev.208.102459
-   Local Identifier: knb-lter-sev.208.102459
-   Title: Effects of Kangaroo Rat Mounds on Seed Banks of Grass and Shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (2001)
-   Time period
    -   Begin: 2001-08-27
    -   End: 2001-08-31
-   Abstract: This dataset examines the seed banks in areas around kangaroo rat mounds compared to other microhabitats. It investigates the quantity and composition of seeds in the seed bank and explores the predictive factors for seed populations in different microhabitats. The study provides insights into the impact of disturbance caused by kangaroo rats on the soil seed bank and its implications for plant community dynamics in arid environments.

## Data and File Overview

-   .gitignore: Used in Git version control to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by Git and exclude them from being staged or committed.

## Methodological Information

The methodological procedures for this study involved the selection and collection of kangaroo rat mounds and soil samples. Out of the 25 active mounds found in the grassland, 10 were randomly chosen for the experiment and marked with unique numbers. Soil samples were collected from ten selected mounds, with sub-samples grouped into four categories: base, surrounding, edge, and interspace. The collection involved using a 10cm diameter soil auger to extract samples from each location. Additionally, physical variables such as undisturbed bare soil, vegetation, litter, gravel, and animal disturbance were recorded within a 900cm2 area to assess their potential impact on seed accumulation. The collected soil samples were then processed by drying them in an oven, sifting them through sieves to separate seeds from larger particles, and subjecting them to a salt solution for further separation and drying. Viability testing and seed counting were conducted, and eight target taxa were identified using a reference collection. The study employed various techniques to ensure accurate data collection and analysis.

# Individual and Community Flowering Phenology, Seed Counts, and Pollinator Visitation Rates

This data package contains data on individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts, and pollinator visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge from 2019 to 2021. The data was collected as part of a study investigating the effects of shrubification on plant reproductive success and community composition in the alpine tundra.

-   Abstract: This dataset investigates the impact of shrubification on flowering phenology, reproductive success, and pollinator visitation rates in the alpine tundra community at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. The study spans three years and includes observations from shrub-influenced and open plots.

## Methodological Information

The study focused on collecting data on community-level flowering phenology, individual-level flowering phenology, pollinator observations, and seed collection. For community-level flowering phenology, 21 common alpine species were monitored weekly during the summers of 2019, 2020, and 2021. Individual-level flowering phenology was observed in 24 plots during the summer of 2021, tracking marked individuals of common alpine species throughout the flowering season. Pollinator observations were conducted in the same plots, recording pollinator activity and functional group. Seed collection targeted five main species, with mature seed pods collected weekly from late August to late September. To assess seed production, seeds were counted and weighed individually after separating them from dried buds. The methodology employed standardized protocols to ensure accurate data collection and involved frequent visits to the plots to capture the dynamics of flowering, pollinator interactions, and seed development. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the flowering patterns, pollinator behavior, and seed production of alpine plant species, contributing to our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and plant-pollinator interactions in alpine environments.\
