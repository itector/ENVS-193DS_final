# Introduction

testing

# Methods

```{r}
# should haves
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(ggeffects)
library(performance)
library(naniar)
library(flextable)
library(car)
library(broom)
library(corrplot)
library(AICcmodavg)
library(GGally)
# would be nice to have
library(MuMIn)
#library(equatiomatic)
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
seed_count <- read_csv(here("data", "shrubstudy_community_flower_counts.ms.data.csv")) %>% 
  # make the column names cleaner
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
# create a data visualization of missing data in seed_count
gg_miss_var(seed_count)
```

```{r}
# calculate pearson's r for numerical values only
seed_count_cor <- seed_count %>% 
  select(shrub_num:counts) %>% 
  cor(use = "everything", method = "pearson")

# creating a correlation plot
corrplot(seed_count_cor,
         # change the shape of what's in the cells
         method = "ellipse",
         addCoef.col = "black"
         )
