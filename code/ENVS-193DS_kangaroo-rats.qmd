# Problem 1. Kangaroo Rats

## Introduction

Disturbance plays a vital biological role in shaping plant community structure, and small-scale disturbances caused by animals can increase heterogeneity and species diversity. Kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds are unique small-scale disturbances that support distinct plant communities compared to surrounding habitats (Guo). The seed bank, often overlooked in plant communities, is an important trait for plant species' persistence in unpredictable environments (Fitch). To understand the impact of kangaroo rat disturbances on plant communities in the Chihuahuan Desert grassland, we studied the composition of the seed bank for eight taxa on and off kangaroo rat mounds. Our objective was to determine if kangaroo rat mounds accumulate more seeds and exhibit different seed compositions compared to the adjacent grassland and our findings revealed that kangaroo rat mounds accumulated more seeds and supported different seed compositions, suggesting their role in promoting plant diversity and altering plant structure within communities (Koontz). Our null hypothesis is that the eight taxa will have seed banks that do not differ between mounds and off mounds and that mounds will not have high seed numbers of early successional plant species; our alternative hypothesis is that the eight taxa will have seed banks that differ between mounds and off mounds and that mounds will have high seed numbers of early successional plant species.

## Methods

```{r}
# should haves
library(MASS) 
library(lme4)
library(glmmTMB)
library(tidyverse)
library(DHARMa)
library(lmtest)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(ggeffects)
library(performance)
library(naniar)
library(flextable)
library(car)
library(broom)
library(corrplot)
library(AICcmodavg)
library(GGally)
library(skimr)
# would be nice to have
library(MuMIn)
#library(equatiomatic)
library(corrplot)
```

```{r load-in-data}
kangaroo_rats <- read_csv(here("data", "dat_for_prob1.csv")) %>% 
  # make the column names cleaner
  clean_names()

# cleaning and wrangling
data <- kangaroo_rats %>%
   # remove rows with missing values
  drop_na()   
```

```{r missing-data-visualization}
# check what variables are missing data
gg_miss_var(kangaroo_rats)
# there is nothing missing
```

**Figure 1. Visualizing Missing Data.** Using \[gg_miss_var\] to evaluate missing data from data set, it is found that there is no missing data. 
:::

```{r skim-data}
# skim the data
skim(kangaroo_rats)
```

```{r assumption-checks}
# assumption checks
# checking normality assumption (is it normally distributed?)
shapiro.test(data$seeds)

# checking homogeneity of variances assumption
leveneTest(seeds ~ loc, data = data)
```

```{r statistical-checks}
# statistical tests
# post hoc test (Tukey's HSD)
tukey_result <- TukeyHSD(anova_result)
tukey_result

# Null hypotheses
# H0: There is no difference in seed counts between locations

# other tools for count (discrete) data:
# Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric alternative to ANOVA)
kruskal.test(seeds ~ loc, data = data)
```
